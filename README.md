# DevilsHubCracked

Devils Hub is a free script hub released mainly for having a pretty good list of games. The only issue is, they log ips and log them to a webhook.

(We already deleted the webhook)

They log ips in a public github and use that as a blacklist system.
(This script Bypasses all blacklists + loggers)

So I've released a script that bypasses pretty much anything logging you if you still want to use this hub securely.

What this blocks:
IP LOGGERS
BLACKLIST SYSTEMS
GROUP CHECK
KICKS

This script also bypasses their really bad key system + autofilling it out for you.

# Please run DEVILCRACKED.lua, not the other one.
